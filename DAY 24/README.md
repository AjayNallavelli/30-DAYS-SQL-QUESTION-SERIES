# üéØ APPROACH -
1. In order to fetch the employee's name and salary, We'll join both tables based on the column 'employee_id'
2. We'll get the list of employee names but we need the employee names who are not even earning any salary. Using left join where the left table is 'employee_details' and the right table is 'employee_salary'
3. We'll get the list of employee names with their salary as per the question

## What is left join?
üìåLEFT JOIN - Return the matching values from both the tables and non-matching records from the left table.
The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.


# üí° INSIGHTS GENERATED -
Employee salary generated.
