-- You are given a list of numbers representing how many emails each Microsoft Outlook user has in their inbox.
-- Before the Product Management team can work on features related to inbox zero or bulk-deleting email, they want to know the mean, median, and mode for the number of emails.
-- ‚ùìOutput the median, median, and mode (in this order). Round the mean to the closest integer and assume that there are no ties for mode

WITH email_mean as
