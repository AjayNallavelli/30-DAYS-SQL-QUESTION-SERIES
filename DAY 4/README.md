### üéØAPPROACH -
You can solve this question with so many approaches, I am using a sub-query within from clause
- in the sub-query, fetching employee_name, job , sal along with calculating avg(salary) using window function
- here calculating avg(sal) with over(),
  üìçOVER() will give the avg. of salary across all the employees as a new column
also, we don't need the avg(salary) based on job/ department, so we can leave inside over() with nothing.
- The FLOOR() function rounds up to the largest integer value that is smaller than or equal to a number.
- At the end, In the main query using a where clause where the employee's salary > avg salary of all employees.

## **:dart: INSIGHTS GENERATED**
 - There is a total of 6 employees who earns more than the overall average salary.
