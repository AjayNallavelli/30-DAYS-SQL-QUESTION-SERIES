# 30-DAYS-SQL-QUESTION-SERIES
I have recently started my SQL Journey few months back and the only thing I follow till now is consistency and eagerness to solve SQL queries. Each skill has its own difficulty level so is SQL has.
- EASY 
- MEDIUM
- HARD
> In this repository, I will share all the questions which I posted on LinkedIn as 30-Days SQL Question Series with thier datasets, questions and their solutions.
All these 30 Questions likely to be asked during interview( or mock interviews) ranging from EASY to DIFFICULT
