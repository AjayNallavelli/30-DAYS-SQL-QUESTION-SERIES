# 30-DAYS-SQL-QUESTION-SERIES
I have recently started my SQL Journey a few months back.
While I was learning SQL, I learned many new things, starting from what are the DDLs, and DMLs to solving complex queries. After I started getting hands-on experience in writing SQL queries, I started posting SQL Problems on LinkedIn with the solutions.

The only thing I have followed till now is consistency and eagerness to solve SQL queries. Each skill has its own difficulty level so does SQL.
- EASY 
- MEDIUM
- HARD

> In this repository, I will share all the questions that I posted on LinkedIn as a 30-Day SQL Question Series with their datasets, questions, and solutions.
All these 30 Questions are likely to be asked during the interview( or mock interviews) ranging from EASY to DIFFICULT.

## DATA SOURCE 
I have listed all the following sources below from where I have taken the questions:
1. DATALEMUR Website(SQL Qestions)
2. Dany Diner's Case Study for SQL
3. Employee dataset
4. HackeRank SQL Quetions
5. Leetcode

I have tried to cover almost all the necessary functions and keywords in this repository.

To master SQL, one should practice SQL consistently.

### I hope that you appreciate this repository as much as you appreciate the 30-Day SQL Question Series.
