### üéØ APPROACH -
üìçdense_rank()/ row_number() makes this type of question quite easier. 
1. Solving this problem using Dense_rank window function and subquery
2. Join both the tables(employee and department) based on the same column(i.e., deptno)
3. using the dense_rank function to fetch employees and their salary for each department based on their salary.
4. As we have a new column, 'rnk', now in the main query filtering salaries where rnk=2 as it denotes the second maximum salary.
